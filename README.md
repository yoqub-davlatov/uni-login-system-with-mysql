## MYSQL IN C++

A basic login system program to some imaginary university. If a student's email address is already in the database, the student can log in, and see related information to them including their GPA and monthly scholarship. If a student is a fresher, they can sign up. Administrators can delete students from the database or update their GPA or monthly scholarship.

Before running the program create the table first (see project.session.sql), and make sure to connect your local database to the program.

Enjoy!
